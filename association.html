            <h3>Dam Runners</h3>
            <p>
                This is a social running group that meets regularly in Vondelpark on Saturday mornings and Wednesday evenings. 
                It welcomes both beginners and experienced runners, with no focus on speed—participants run at their own pace. 
                After the Saturday run, there’s a social gathering at a local café. Saturday runs start at 9:30 am, covering 9 
                to 15 km, while Wednesday sessions at 6:30 pm involve shorter runs and interval exercises. The meeting point is 
                in front of the statue at Vondel CS, with a map provided for exact location details.

            <h3>We Run Amsterdam</h3>
            <p>
                This group is known for its social approach to running, making it fun and inclusive for all levels of runners. 
                They organize regular group runs, often exploring different scenic areas of the city, such as Vondelpark or along 
                the canals. The emphasis is on creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere rather than just focusing on performance. 
                Participants can join runs at various distances, and after some runs, there’s a social gathering, typically at a 
                local café. It’s a great way to meet fellow runners and stay active.

            <h3>TCS Amsterdam Marathon</h3>
            <p>
                The TCS Amsterdam Marathon is a World Athletics Platinum Label Road Race, recognized for its fast course and ranked 
                as the fourth fastest marathon globally. The race starts and finishes in the Olympic Stadium, passing iconic landmarks 
                like the Rijksmuseum, Heineken Experience, Amstel River, and Vondelpark. On the same day, a half-marathon and 8K will 
                also take place. Amsterdam offers beautiful sights like museums, canals, and quaint cafes, with easy transportation by 
                foot, bicycle, or public transport. Marathon packages for 2024 include a hotel near Amsterdam South train station, 
                providing easy access to the race and Schiphol airport. The hotel is perfectly positioned for spectators, and runners 
                can enjoy warm-up runs, pasta dinners, and support from the Marathon Tours & Travel team.
